Overview: Empowering the decision maker on how to progress through their career. Manager can see aggregated list of an employeeâ€™s career journey. Individual employee can see the requirements of what it takes to move from one level to the next in their career journey.

Deliverables:

Propose and design a solution that will carry out the following tasks at the minimum:

What skills sets an employee needs to have to progress within a specific skills trade. As an example, Entry-level welder to Mid-career welder.
Provide both the employee and manager the ability to scan and upload certifications of a plant employee.
Provide the employee the opportunity to create their profile and upload all their relevant skills set at each stage of their career journey.
Deliverable/solution solves these pain points:

A plant manager not having a complete view of the level of expertise for any given job within a manufacturing plant.
The desire of plant employees to have transparency into what it takes to move up the ranks within their job specification e.g. Go from entry-level welder to experience welder.
